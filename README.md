# flutter_template

My first attempt at making a Flutter development template.

Fairly new to Flutter but my goals for the template are:
- Feature driven folder structure for modularity and reusability
- BLoC based state management
- Slight adaptation of the Navigator 2.0 to use BLoC (disliked how close it was to BLoC without actually being BLoC like everything else)
- Full array of basic features that will be common across most apps (Themes, Accounts, Settings, etc.)
- More to come as I work on it
